1.) 
  a.)  Constant.  Doesn't matter how big the crowd is.
  b.)  Linear.  Every input increase has to be calculated. (10 times the people take 10 times as long)

2.) O(1) (constant), doesn't matter how large the number is, just returns true/false.

3.) O(n^2) (quadratic) If you double the input, you quadruple the running time.   

4.) O(n) (linear)  Every item must be calculated

5.) O(n) (linear)  Worst case:  every item must be searched.  Each search is a tick.

6.) O(n^2) (quadratic/polynomial) Nested loop, each item added to the input is item^2 number of extra ticks

7.) Creates fibonacci sequence for the input number (where the array index is the "traditional" sequence index)
    O(n) linear, because for each increment of the input, we have to do one more tick in the loop
